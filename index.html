  <p>Hello! My name is Gabriel Kassie, and I am the creator of Project Influence. To learn more about me, here is a
    link to my <a href="https://gkassie.github.io/" target="blank">personal website.</a></p>
  <p>This website will expose you to immigration and nuclear weapons and will have plenty of sub-topics to explore.
    The goal of this website is to help you learn and influence you by showing you injustice. It is up to you about
    how you choose to act.</p>
  <p>In the navigation bar, you can click any of the three tabs that will redirect you to different aspects. "Why
    Immigrate?" to learn more about why people choose to immigrate and the problems they face in their countries.
    There will also be real world examples of countries demonstrating these conflicts. The "Nuclear Weapons" tab will
    expose you to a summary of the past and present of atomic bombs. Finally, the “Radiation” tab will explore the
    present and future,
    with a focus on revealing the negative impacts and certain groups' calls to action.</p>
