  <h1>Nuclear Weapons</h1>
  <h2>Trinity Test Site and Oppenheimer</h2>
  <p>Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist who studied in the U.S.A. and Europe. He became a professor at U.C.
    Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. During his era, there were many physicists and scientific
    discoveries. Oppenheimer did research on what occurs during the death of stars. Americans believed that the Nazis
    might be developing atomic weapons and were ahead of them. General Groves, a military leader, sought Oppenheimer to
    be the leader of the Manhattan Project. They chose Los Alamos, New Mexico, as their central site for the
    development. The Los Alamos Lab was seized from Native American ancestral lands and Hispanic homesteaders without
    adequate compensation. They hired many scientists and engineers to conduct research. As they began to experiment and
    more discoveries occurred, the team began to harness the power of nuclear fission and find other alternatives to
    creating nuclear weapons.</p>

  <h2>Nuclear Weapons and U.S.A./U.S.S.R. Tension</h2>
  <p>The true reason for the development of nuclear weapons was to target the U.S.S.R. After WWII, the Soviet Union
    rapidly developed its nuclear arms program and tested its bombs faster than the US anticipated. Meanwhile, the US
    maintained its arsenal. An arms race ensued, and each country began building their own bigger and better weapons.
    This rivalry bled into the Cold War, and the U.S. developed a hydrogen bomb.</p>

  <h2>Archdiocese of Santa Fe</h2>
  <p>Archbishop John C. Wester wrote a pastoral letter called Living in the Light of Christ’s Peace: A Conversation
    Toward Nuclear Disarmament.</p>
  <p>The letter begins with the archbishop detailing how he traveled through Japan and visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
    He states that “in one exhibit, I read about schoolchildren in Hiroshima who, on that fateful morning in August
    1945, ran to the windows, attracted by a bright light. I wonder how many were running to their deaths, either
    instantaneously incinerated or dying later in agonizing pain. Normally, light brings new life and clearer vision.
    Not that day. Sadly, the light generated by the first nuclear explosion used in war brought only destruction and
    death.” American history, the winners, shows us only one side of the story: the good.</p>
  <p>Pope Francis is a strong advocate who has steered the Church away from nuclear weapons and war because they are
    immoral. During a visit to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he said that “the use of atomic energy for purposes of war is
    today, more than ever, a crime not only against the dignity of human beings but against any possible future for our
    common home…The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral, just as the possession of atomic weapons is
    immoral.” One of Jesus’ main teachings was about nonviolence: love your enemies. The Kingdom of God is about peace
    and love not war and injustice.</p>
  <p>Archbishop Wester believes there must be a massive comprehensive cleanup of the Los Alamos National Laboratory to
    create jobs and save the environment. New Mexico ranks 49th in U.S.A. states income per capita. He states “we could
    mobilize the resources used for nuclear weapons in New Mexico for solar, wind, and geothermal resources, which will
    be needed as we stop extracting fossil fuels.” Also, these funds for nuclear war preparation could go towards ending
    poverty and hunger.</p>
