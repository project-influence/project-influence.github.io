  <h1>Why Immigrate?</h1>
  <p>People decide to leave their home countries and are influenced by a multitude of factors including economic,
    political, and social factors. Most tend to leave their country because of the injustice that they face there and/or
    leave due to the promises and opportunities they will receive in their new host country. These two categories can be
    broken down into internal vs. international. This page will explore both of these categories through countries
    representing multiple continents, acting as case studies, and how their citizens tend to immigrate towards the
    U.S.A.</p>

  <h2>Africa: Ethiopia and Political Instability</h2>
  <p>Ethiopia is a country with many ethnic and regional groups that have come in conflict with each other throughout
    the years. My parents both immigrated from Ethiopia with my father seeking refuge and my mother seeking
    opportunities.</p>
  <p>The Tigray War was a two year conflict that was fought by the Ethiopian and Eirtrean governments vs. the Tigray
    People Liberation Front. This was a brutal armed conflict that destroyed civilian structers like hospitals, schools,
    and factories. The government accused TPLF of attacking a Tigray air base in November 2020. Then, they intervened
    and caused atrocities like sexual violence and food shortages. This conflict exposed the challenges of ethnic
    federalism, which divides the country into districts associated with and recognize ethnic groups and communities.

  <h2>North/Central America: Guatemala and Violence</h2>
  <p>Guatemala is a country that has and is facing high levels of gang-related violence, organized crime, and drug
    trafficking. Families and citizens feel fear and some decide to seek safety in other countries.</p>
  <p>Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 (18th Street Gang) are two prominent gangs that originated in Los Angles
    including refugees from Central American countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. These gangs are
    associated with homicides, assualts, and extortion. They seek territorial control over their neigbhbors and engage
    in violent conflicts with each other and rival groups. They target the vulnerable youth to recruit them and can pure
    pressure or threaten the youth to join them. Both of these gangs use extortion, which involves threatening people
    until they are forced to comply for financial gain.</p>

  <h2>South America: Venezuela and Humanitarian Needs</h2>
  <p>Venezuela is a country that has a severe humanitarian situation with shortages of food, water, and medical
    supplies. The government has restricted humanitarian access which creates challenges for getting external aid into
    the country.</p>

  <p>The agriculture sector has had a shortage of production inputs. Venezuela has depended highly on food imports but
    due to the economic collapse, it has been challenging to purchase these goods from international markets. With the
    scarcity of nutritious food, groups like children, elderly, and preganant women have experienced malnutrition. Many
    qualified healthcare professionals have left the country. Medical equipment and essential medications have been
    scarce. Healthcare infrastructure has been neglegcted and unmaintained </p>

  <h2>Europe: Greece and Economic Challenges</h2>
  <p>Greece is a country with a rich and deep history as an ancient civilization, resulting in the country being a
    popular tourist destination. Greece's economy is diverse, with sectors such as tourism, shipping, agriculture, and
    services playing crucial roles.</p>

  <p>After the global recession crisis began in 2008, there was a period of financial instability, high debt, and
    unemployment. High unemployment among youth makes it difficult to support families. Greece had received substantial
    assistance from the EU and, as a result, owed them debt. Measures, like increased taxes and public spending cuts,
    were taken to reduce government budget deficits. Additionally, Greece has had a crisis with a migration influx of
    refugees due to its easy entrance point to Europe. </p>

  <h2>Asia: India and Educational Opportunities</h2>
  <p>India is a culturally and religiously diverse country while being one of the largest countries by land area and
    population. A significant portion of the population lives in poverty, there are many environmental challenges like
    air and water pollution, and there is an urban-rural divide with a lack of education in rural areas. </p>

  <p>Citizens tend to immigrate to the U.S.A. to receive a higher education and for employment. They study at well
    recognized universities and have access to things like research, resources, and different programs compared to
    India. Students can create social networks with friends and alumni. They can be exposed to new cultures and learn
    English, possibly even becoming permanent residents of their new host country.</p>
